The OpenBB SDK provides programmatic access to all Terminal functions. This layer of code allows users to build their own tools and applications on top of the existing architecture. Follow these steps to install on a local machine.

:::note NOTE

- Make sure you meet all [requirements](requirements.md) before proceeding.
- If the Finance Analysis has already been installed in a virtual Python environment, no additional installations are required.

## 1. System Preparation

Prepare the system by installing the following items:

### 1.1 Install Miniconda

[Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Miniconda is a Python environment and package manager. It is required for installing certain dependencies.

- Go [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links) to find the download for your operating system or use the links below:

  - Apple-Silicon Systems: [Miniconda for MacOS](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.pkg)
  - Intel-based Mac Systems: [Miniconda for MacOS](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh)
  - Linux and WSL Systems: [Miniconda for Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)
  - Raspberry PI Systems: [Miniconda for Raspberry PI](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh)
  - Windows Systems: [Miniconda for Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe)

    **NOTE for Apple Silicon Users:** Install Rosetta from the command line: `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`

    **NOTE for Windows users:** Install/update Microsoft C++ Build Tools from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

### 1.2 Install CMake

**CMake is required by several Python modules.**

**For Windows:**

CMake is installed as a part of Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Skip ahead to the next step.

**For MacOS:**

Check if homebrew is installed by running `brew --version`

If Homebrew is not installed, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install cmake
brew install gcc
```

If Homebrew is already installed:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install gcc
```

**For Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y gcc cmake
```

## 2. Create Python Environment

The first step is to create the virtual Python environment.

### 2.1 Confirm Conda Base

When a terminal window is opened, if the base Conda environment - look for `(base)` to the left of the cursor on the command line - is not activated automatically, find the path for it by entering:

```console
conda env list
```

Copy the path which corresponds with `base`, and activate it with:

```console
conda activate REPLACE_WITH_PATH
```

Check which `conda` version is installed by entering:

```console
conda -V
```

As of writing, the most recent version of `Conda` is, `23.1.0`. If required, update from a lower version with:

```console
conda install -c conda-forge -n base conda=23.1.0
```

### 2.2 Create the Environment

Create the environment by copying the code below into the command line:

```console
conda create -n obb -c conda-forge python=3.10.9 pip pybind11 cmake git cvxpy lightgbm poetry
```

### 2.3 Activate the Environment

After the packages from Step 2 install, activate the newly created environment by entering:

```console
conda activate obb
```

## 3. Install the OpenBB SDK

### 3A. Install From PyPi

```bash
pip install "openbb[all]"
```

Done! The OpenBB SDK can now be imported to any Python session with the line of code below.

```console
from openbb_terminal.sdk import openbb
```

The [Finance Analysis](https://docs.openbb.co/terminal) is part of the installation, and the application can be launched from the command line by entering:

```console
openbb
```

### 3B. Install via Git Clone

#### 3B.1 Clone the Project

Cloning the GitHub repo will download the source code to the current working directory.

```console
git clone https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git
```

#### 3B.2 CD into OpenBBTerminal

```console
cd OpenBBTerminal
```

#### 3B.3 Install Remaining Packages

```bash
pip install qdldl==0.1.5.post3
poetry install -E all
```

Done! The OpenBB SDK can now be imported to any Python session with the line of code below.

```console
from openbb_terminal.sdk import openbb
```

The Terminal application is also installed, and it can be launched from the command line at the root `OpenBBTerminal` folder with:

```console
python terminal.py
```

## Updating the OpenBB SDK Version

Use the code below to check the version number of the OpenBB SDK.

```python
from openbb_terminal.sdk import openbb
openbb.__version__
```

Which prints a string similar to: `'2.4.1'`

### A. Updating a PyPi Installation

To upgrade the OpenBB SDK to the latest version, with the `obb` Python environment active, enter:

```console
pip install -U openbb[all]
```

### B. Updating a Git Clone Installation

#### B.1 Fetch changes to the code

With the `obb` Python environment activated, navigate into the root folder of the cloned project. Then, pull the changes from GitHub:

```console
git fetch
git pull
```

**Note:** If working from a forked repo, the `git pull` command will need to be adjusted to pull from the desired branch, like `origin` or `upstream`. For example, `git pull origin main`; `git pull origin develop`

#### B.2 Run Poetry Install

Update any changes to the dependencies by running:

```console
poetry install -E all
```
