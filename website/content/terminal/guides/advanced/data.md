## The OpenBBUserData Folder

The `OpenBBUserData` folder is where files are saved when they are created from within the Finance Analysis, like exports and generated reports. It is also where user-generated files are stored, such as:

- Screener presets
- Portfolio files
- Exported files
- Files to be imported by various functions
- Styles and themes

The folder's location is at the root of user account for the operating system.

- Linux: `~/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`
- macOS: `Macintosh HD/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\OpenBBUserData`

**Note:** With a WSL-enabled Windows installation, this folder will be under the Linux partition

## Exporting Files

Most Terminal functions have the ability to export results as a file to the `OpenBBUserData` folder. This can be confirmed by engaging the help dialogue.

```console
/economy/fred --help
```

```console
usage: fred [-p PARAMETER] [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE] [-q QUERY [QUERY ...]] [-h] [--export EXPORT] [--sheet-name SHEET_NAME [SHEET_NAME ...]] [--raw] [-l LIMIT]

Query the FRED database and plot data based on the Series ID. [Source: FRED]

options:
  -p PARAMETER, --parameter PARAMETER
                        Series ID of the Macro Economic data from FRED (default: )
  -s START_DATE, --start START_DATE
                        Starting date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
  -e END_DATE, --end END_DATE
                        Ending date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
  -q QUERY [QUERY ...], --query QUERY [QUERY ...]
                        Query the FRED database to obtain Series IDs given the query search term. (default: None)
  -h, --help            show this help message (default: False)
  --export EXPORT       Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx and figure into png, jpg, pdf, svg (default: )
  --sheet-name SHEET_NAME [SHEET_NAME ...]
                        Name of excel sheet to save data to. Only valid for .xlsx files. (default: None)
  --raw                 Flag to display raw data (default: False)
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        Number of entries to show in data. (default: 100)

For exporting data from tables, the valid output types are:

- CSV
- JSON
- XLSX

Images can be exported as:

- JPG
- PDF
- PNG
- SVG

Deploying the `--export` flag can include just the file type:

```console
/stocks/ $ load aapl --export csv
```

```console
Loading Daily data for AAPL with starting period 2020-02-13.
Saved file: /Users/danglewood/OpenBBUserData/exports/20230217_204550_OpenBBTerminal_openbb_terminal_load_AAPL.csv
```

Or, the file can be named explicitly:

```console
/stocks/ $ load aapl --export aapl_daily.csv
```

```console
Loading Daily data for AAPL with starting period 2020-02-13.
Saved file: /Users/danglewood/OpenBBUserData/exports/aapl_daily.csv
```

When `xlsx` is the file type, an additional argument for the sheet name is available. The purpose of this functionality is to export multiple items to the same spreadsheet; for example:

```console
/stocks/load aapl --export watchlist.xlsx --sheet-name AAPL
```

```console
Loading Daily data for AAPL with starting period 2020-02-13.
Saved file: /Users/danglewood/OpenBBUserData/exports/watchlist.xlsx
```

```console
/stocks/load msft --export watchlist.xlsx --sheet-name MSFT
```

```console
Loading Daily data for MSFT with starting period 2020-02-13.
Saved file: /Users/danglewood/OpenBBUserData/exports/watchlist.xlsx
```

## Importing Data

Menus, such as Econometrics, Forecast, or Portfolio, allow the user to import their own dataset. Files available to import will be included with the choices presented by auto-complete. In the Econometrics menu, this is activated after pressing the space bar, `load -f`.

![Loading data in the Econometrics menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/221930794-d754e63f-262f-410b-b698-e03823c5d30b.png)

The Econometrics menu looks at the `exports` and `custom_imports/econometrics` folder. The `portfolio` menu looks in the `portfolio/holdings` folder whereas the `portfolio/po` menu looks at the `portfolio/allocation` and `portfolio/optimization` folder for the load and file command respectively. Please make sure to read the relevant guides to understand how this works.

## Custom Path for OpenBBUserData folder

The location of this folder can be set by the user from the /settings menu. There should be no need to update paths in this menu unless the folders have been moved manually. If the location of the OpenBBUserData folder must be changed, it is best to move the entire existing folder to the new path. The path is then changed under the settings menu with:

```console
userdata --folder "/complete_path_to/OpenBBUserData"
```
